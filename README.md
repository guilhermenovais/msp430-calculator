# MSP430 Calculator

## About

This is a simple React.js app that does simple bitwise operations to help on the development of C codes for MSP430 projects. It can do 4 basic bitwise operations: AND (&), OR(|), Exclusive OR (^) and NOT (~). 
The operations are made between two bytes (two sets of eight bits). The first bit of the first byte is operated with the first bit of the second byte and results in the first bit of the "result" byte, and so on. 
This app also converts each set of 4 bits to it's equivalent hexadecimal digit.
